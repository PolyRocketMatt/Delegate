<h1 align="center">Delegate</h1>

Delegate is a simple yet powerful command delegation framework for Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugins.
It allows for the creation, management and execution of commands.

## Why choose Delegate?

In the past many command frameworks have been created for various Minecraft server
implementations. Personally, I feel like most of these weren't exactly what I
was personally looking for. These command frameworks where either lacking features
or becoming convoluted very quickly. 

Delegate mitigates these problems by allowing the creation of simple commands, but 
also allows for the creation of complex commands with subcommands, tab completion,
brigadier support and more. Unlike most command frameworks, at it's core Delegate
does not use annotation based command creation (it is however possible to use 
annotations).

- Autonomic command handling
