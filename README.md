<h1 align="center">Delegate</h1>

Delegate is a simple yet powerful command delegation framework for Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugins.
It allows for the creation, management and execution of commands.

## Why choose Delegate?

Even though there are many extremely powerful command frameworks out there, they all
lack the simplicity I was personally looking for. They either are lacking in features
or become convoluted very quickly. Delegate tries to mitigate this by providing simple
yet very powerful command creation.

## Features

- Simple yet powerful command creation
- Autonomic command handling
- Platform-agnostic ([Supported Platforms](#supported-platforms))
- Brigadier integration
- Automatic tab completion
- Runtime-based command registration and execution
- Many more...

## Supported Platforms

Currently, Delegate supports the following platforms:

- Bukkit
- Spigot
- Paper
- Velocity
